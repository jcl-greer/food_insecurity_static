## Food Insecurity in the United States

This project explores food insecurity in the United States during the 2010's at the state level, using Pandas and the Altair visualization library in Python. I edited the visuals and designed the report with Figma. This project focuses on geographic and temporal trends in food insecurity rates and situates these trends within some historical context. Beyond providing details on food insecurity rates, it also compares total food insecure populations and aggregated food budget shortfalls by state.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project was generously provided by Feeding America. It is derived from their Map the Meal Gap dataset. The food waste data was derived from the EPA's Excess Opportunities Food Map and ReFED's Insight Engine.
